    <string name="t4_p1">When you complete a bitcoin transaction, the transaction is recorded across all computers connected to the bitcoin network in 2 to 5 seconds. Eventually the transaction is recorded on the blockchain, but it first arrives at the mempool (or "memory pool") to be processed. At the mempool, your transaction is acknowledged by the network, but not yet made official on the blockchain.</string>
    <string name="t4_p2">To be made official, bitcoin miners race to discover a solution to a complex hashing puzzle. Once the solution is discovered, this leads to a block of transactions officially added to the blockchain.</string>

    <string name="t4_h1">Imagine a bus</string>
    <string name="t4_p3">Imagine a bus coming to pick up passengers every 10 or so minutes. The bus can only take a certain amount of weight. Since every passenger is a different weight, the amount of passengers that can fit on the bus changes every time.</string>
    <string name="t4_p4">The mempool acts as the bus stop. A lineup of transactions wait in the mempool to be processed into a block on the blockchain. The transactions wait for their turn to be mined.</string>

    <string name="t4_h2">Some passengers</string>
    <string name="t4_p5">Some passengers might be in a hurry to get on the next bus. They can pay an extra fare to make sure they are near the front of the line. These transactions will be prioritized in the mining process.</string>
    <string name="t4_p6">On the other hand, some passengers might not be in a hurry at all. In that case, they might want to save their money by not paying a higher fare. Eventually, the line will clear and every transaction waiting in line does get through.</string>
