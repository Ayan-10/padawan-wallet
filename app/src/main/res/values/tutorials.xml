        You should think of the Bitcoin network as thousands of computers who speak a common language and communicate with each other over the internet. But even though the biggest and most well known of these computer networks is the one you\'re most familiar with and the one most people speak of when they say \"the Bitcoin network\", there are in fact three different types of Bitcoin networks one might use.\n\nThe most well known of those is called <i>mainnet</i>, and refers to the bitcoins that have monetary value and can be traded on exchanges. The other two networks are built for testing and training, and are used by software developers who need to develop and test their software, and by humans who wish to learn how to use Bitcoin without the worry of protecting and sending around "real" (mainnet) bitcoins.\n\nThose two testing networks are called the regtest (short for <i>regression testing network</i>) and testnet (short for test network).\n\n

        <h3>Regtest</h3>

        The regtest network is a sort of "micro" bitcoin network software developers use to start an instance of a bitcoin network locally (on a single computer, for example, or between a few computer under a single person\'s control). It is useful because one can control all aspects of the network and nodes (mining new blocks, creating and deleting nodes, etc.). It is a network that is almost uniquely used by software developers.\n\n

        <h3>Tesnet</h3>

        The testnet consists of a full-fledged bitcoin network that is available worldwide, and connects thousands of nodes (just like mainnet). The bitcoins on this network are often called <i>testnet coins</i>, and look and behave most identically to normal bitcoin, except that they have no value! This feature is extremely useful for testing applications in the real world. It also allows curious minds to explore bitcoin in a real way, make transactions, back up wallets, and understand the foundational building blocks of the network without having to touch real bitcoin before they get comfortable with the basic set of heuristics that bitcoin requires users to understand in order to use it safely and effectively.

        It is unfortunate but the word "bitcoin" has two completely different meanings. We speak of <i>Bitcoin</i> the network, the protocol, the open source project, and we also use the word "bitcoin" as one of the units of value when transacting on that network.\n\n

        A bitcoin is a unit of value that can easily be broken down in smaller parts. Just like the kilometer can be broken down into meters and centimeters and the dollar can be broken down into quarters, dimes, and pennies, bitcoin can be broken into smaller units.\n\n

        While there are many units to describe bitcoin, we believe only two of those to be important: the <i>bitcoin</i> and the <i>satoshi</i>. There are one hundred million (100,000,000) satoshis in a bitcoin.\n\n

        100,000,000 satoshis = 1 bitcoin\n
        1 satoshi = 0.00000001 bitcoin\n\n

        Depending on the size of a transaction, it is often more appropriate to think of the amount transacted as being in bitcoin or in satoshis. A brand new car might be worth 1.7 bitcoins (1,700,000,000 sats is not as easy for the eye to quickly understand), whereas a candy might be worth 250 satoshis (0.00000250 bitcoin is harder to read).\n\n

        The ability to use both units is an important skill to develop. A lot of transactions are denominated in bitcoin, but their _network fee_ (tutorial #4) is almost always written in satoshis.\n\n

        You can switch between the two units in the main wallet display page by touching the bitcoin/satoshi symbol.\n\n
