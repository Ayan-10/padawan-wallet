A testnet-only bitcoin wallet full of tutorials on how to use bitcoin wallets.

The goal of this project is to be the app you'd recommend to your teenage cousins at Christmas or your dad that keeps asking questions about bitcoin. It aims to be a self-study tool, getting its users acquainted with the usual workflow and basic jargon of mobile wallets in an risk-free environment perfect for experimentation and learning (testnet).

The builders of this wallet are of the opinion that testnet is an underused resource outside of software development circles, and believe it can be leveraged for bitcoin-curious people everywhere. Testnet offers all the complexity of mainnet, and one of the goal of this wallet is to eventually foray into these more advanced bitcoin features (multisig, DLCs, etc.) and offer a trainning/testing ground for users.

If you think this project is interesting and would like to contribute, get access to the early release on the app store, or simply provide feedback and bounce ideas, check out [our discord group](https://discord.gg/qTysDfZ2gX)!
